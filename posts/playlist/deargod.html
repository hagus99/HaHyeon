        Dear God<br>
        I've been trying awful hard to make You proud of me <br>
        But it seems<br>
        The harder that I try, the harder it becomes<br>
        And I feel like giving up<br>
        Most of the time<br>
        <br>
        Dear God<br>
        I've been chasing their approval and it's killin' me<br>
        And I know<br>
        The more I try to prove, the less I have to show<br>
        <br>
        And I'm stuck inside my head<br>
        Most of the time<br>
        <br>
        But if I pray a little harder<br>
        If I follow all the rules<br>
        I wonder could I ever be enough<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I try and try<br>
        Just to fall back down again<br>
        And I ask myself why<br>
        Do I try to chase the wind?<br>
        I should lean into the mystery<br>
        Maybe hope is found in a melody<br>
        So I wanna try again<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dear child<br>
        I hope you know how much I love you<br>
        And I'm proud of you<br>
        And please believe<br>
        The thoughts I have for you will never change or fade away<br>
        And when you felt like giving up<br>
        I never did<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I'm not scared of imperfections<br>
        Or the questions in your head<br>
        Just know that you have always been enough<br>
        <br>
        'Cause you tried and you tried<br>
        And I saw you wrestle with<br>
        Every how, every why<br>
        I was right there listening<br>
        So just fall into the mystery<br>
        I'll meet you here in the melody<br>
        Try just to try again<br>
        Oh, child, would you try agin<br>
        My child, you can love agin<br>
